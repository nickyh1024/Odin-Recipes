        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Bossam is a pork dish in Korean cuisine.
            It usually consists of pork shoulder 
            that is boiled in spices and thinly 
            sliced. The meat is served with side 
            dishes such as spicy radish salad, 
            sliced raw garlic, ssamjang, saeu-jeot, 
            kimchi, and ssam vegetables such as 
            lettuce or cabbage. Bossam is usually 
            paired with a special sauce made up of a 
            Korean Gochujang base, sesame oil, miso,
            and honey.</p>
