# Odin-Recipes
My first website: A recipe book!

In this project, I want to practice my HTML skills by providing some of my favorite recipes. Eventually, I will add some CSS to give it a more aesthetic look!

I will be making this website to practice implementing lists, headers, body, and more tags in HTML.
